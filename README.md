# Gauss-Elimination-Solver-for-Linear-Equations
# Description:
This Python program implements the Gauss elimination method to solve systems of linear equations. It's designed to closely mimic the step-by-step process you'd follow when solving equations by hand, making it easy to understand and follow the algorithm.
# Key Features:
•	Clear Step-by-Step Execution: Each stage of the Gauss elimination process is clearly delineated, making it easy to visualize the algorithm's flow.
•	By-Hand Calculation Resemblance: The code's structure and output closely resemble the manual process of solving linear equations using Gauss elimination, enhancing its educational value.
•	Step-by-Step Tracing: By uncommenting the print statements, you can observe each intermediate step of the calculation, providing a detailed understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.
# Usage:
1.	Install Requirements: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (NumPy). You can do this using pip install numpy.
2.	Prepare Your Equations: Input your linear equations in the specified format (e.g., as a matrix).
3.	Run the Program: Execute the Python script.
4.	View Results: The program will output the solution to your system of linear equations.
# Additional Tips:
•	Error Handling: Consider adding error handling to check for invalid input provide informative messages.
•	Efficiency: For larger systems, explore optimizations like pivoting to improve numerical stability and efficiency.
•	Code Comments: Use clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of different code sections, making it easier for others to understand and maintain your program.
